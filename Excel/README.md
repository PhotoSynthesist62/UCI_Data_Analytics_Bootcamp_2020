# UCI_Data_Analytics_Bootcamp_2020
I'd been eyeing up the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp for years, but I was a busy manager (the kind of job that is at least 4 jobs, on any given day) so I could never make the commitment. In that respect, getting laid off was a gift. There was suddenly a lot more space in my brain, if not necessarily my day-to-day life.  

This repository is a compilation of the individual and group assigments I completed during the intensive 6 month program.
