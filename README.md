# UCI_Data_Analytics_Bootcamp_2020

This repository is a compilation of the individual assignments I completed during the intensive 6 month program. 

Originally, each assigment was located in a unique repository, but this ultimately felt too messy to me. I consolidated all the work into a single repository, but I couldn't get the content to move over to the new repository within GitHub so as to retain 250+ historical commits. (I'll figure it out eventually!)
