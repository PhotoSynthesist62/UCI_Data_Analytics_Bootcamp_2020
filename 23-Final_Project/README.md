## Final Project

My Final Project was a study of the Machine Learning concepts I learned in this course.

I used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which consists of 10000 astronimical observations that determine whether the viewed object is a Galaxy, Quasar or a Star.

My goal was to investigate the data, test several classification machine learning models to identify the most useful, and illustrate that model with an interactive web app supported by database.
