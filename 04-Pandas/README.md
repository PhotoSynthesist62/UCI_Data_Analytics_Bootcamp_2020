## 04 - Pandas Challenge

### PyCitySchools
A Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library to merge and analyze two datasets: student test results in math & reading (students_complete.csv) and institutional data (schools_complete.csv) for a city school district. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase apparent performance trends. The analysis is intended to assist the district board and Mayor in making strategic decisions that will affect future school budgets and priorities.
